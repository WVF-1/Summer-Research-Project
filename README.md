# Summer Research Project
Utilized real time data gathered from personal garden to see if there are any important factors for determining plant growth overtime.

# Data Set Utilized
Gathered and recorded data from personal garden in order to run calculations and computations to determine growth over time. 

**Data Description**

- **Date:**  Date underwhich the data was recorded. 
- **Plant_Type:**  Categorical variable describing the rough type of plant. These being "Flowering", "Nonflowering", and "Tree".
- **Plant_Size:**  Categorical variable describing the t-shirt size of the plant in respect to others within its type. This variable is in sizes of "Small", "Medium", and "Large".
- **Low:**  The daily low temperature in degrees fahrenhite. 
- **High:**  The daily high temperature in degrees fahrenhite. 
- **Temp_Diff:**  The difference between the daily high and low temperature. 
- **Rain:**  Daily rain fall in inches
- **Growth:**  Increase in plant size from the prior measurement in inches. In other words how much bigger a plant has become since the last instance of recording. 
- **Pruned:**  Was the plant pruned on the given date. 
- **Quadrant:**  After dividing the garden up into four equally sized quadrants, which of the four quadrants the plant is in. 
- **Shade:**  This is a categorical and objective analysis of what shade of green the given plant is. This variable can be "Bright", "Neutral", or "Dark", with "Bright" indicating the healthiest plant and "Dark" indicating the least healthy plant. 
- **UV:**  This is the maximum UV exposure that any biological being will be exposed to during the day from the sun.
- **Humidity:**  The average amount of water in the air, as a percentage from 0-1.
- **Dew_Point:**  The temperature of the day that is required for the air to be sufficiently cooled in order for the air around to be saturated to a relative humidty of 100%.
- **Pressure:**  Force of air pressure pushing down from the atmosphere in inches.
- **Wind_Gust:**  The maximum force of the wind on the given day in miles per hour.
- **Cloud_Cover:**  The percentage of the sky which is covered by clouds throughout the day, from 0-1.
- **Visibility:**  The maximum range which a person should be able to see infront of them at any given time in miles.
- **AQI:**  The Air Quality Index (AQI) how clean or polluted the air is on a given day, with the lower being better and more clean air for you to be able to breathe.
- **Pollen:**  The amount of pollen which is in the air.
